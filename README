NAME

	Math::Logic::Predicate - Query a database in predicate calculus form.
	Version 0.03

DESCRIPTION

	Math::Logic::Predicate is an implementation which can prove statements
	based on first order predicate calculus assertions (think Prolog). 
	At the moment, it is only a subset of the predicate calculus, but by 
	version 1.0 at the latest it will support the entire system.  It is 
	written entirely in Perl, and it's really fast, too. See the 
	documentation for more details.

PREREQUISITES

	Math::Logic::Predicate uses Parse::RecDescent.

INSTALLATION

	perl Makefile.PL
	make && make test && make install
